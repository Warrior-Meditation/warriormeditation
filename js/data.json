      "description": "Insight meditation is the oldest and most widely practiced form of meditation. This practice involves watching the breath and observing the thoughts and emotions that arise as you attempt to quiet your mind. As you witness these thoughts and emotions, visualize them being released.  By releasing your thoughts and emotions, you can reduce the power they have over your conscious mind.",

      "description": "Body scan meditation is based on the practice of Yoga Nidra. You will begin by setting an intention for your practice, then watching your breath and scanning your body. Emotions and thoughts will arise as you do an internal scan of your body; by learning to recognize a discursive thought or emotion and return your focus to the practice, you will improve your ability to deal with similar thoughts and emotions in your everyday life.",

      "slug": "shapeshifting",
      "description": "For thousands of years, meditators have drawn from the natural world as a source for guidance and inspiration. The practice of shapeshifting allows you to step outside of yourself as you envision aspects of your mind from the frame of reference of an animal entity. This separation allows for more compassion and imagination in dealing with your strengths and weaknesses. The goal is the realization that the strengths and weaknesses that you perceive in an animal are the same strengths and weaknesses that you perceive in yourself, allowing you to appreciate your strengths and begin to eliminate weaknesses.",
